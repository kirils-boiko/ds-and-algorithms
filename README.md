# Java Data Structure and Algorithms


## What is it?

A project designed for extensive load testing of Java Collections API and custom Java implementations of
various data structures and algorithms. For the detailed overview of the data structures and algorithms included in the project refer to **__Data Structures__** and **__Algorithms__** sections.

The four main focus areas of this project are:

 - Developing **_custom Java implementations of data structures and algorithms_** based on 
[Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms) and [Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms) courses from University of California San Diego & HSE University available on Coursera, and on [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university), a multi-month study plan for becoming a software engineer, by [John Washam](https://github.com/jwasham);
 - **_Setting up a local PostgreSQL database_** containing extra data on Ethereum cryptocurrency collected from Binance's official API and obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-ethereum), and **_connecting the database to Java_** load testing applications using JDBC;
 - **_Performing load testing_** of custom Java and Java Collections API implementations of
data structures and algorithms, and comparing their performances;
 - **_Performance and stress testing_** of custom Java implementations of data structures and algorithms **only**, where corresponding Java Collections API or Java Math API implementations are not available;
